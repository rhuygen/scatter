# Scatter

"Scatter" is a collection of scripts that are spread out or dispersed, much like scattered seeds. The name stands for the idea that the scripts are individual, dynamic, standalone pieces that can be used in various contexts. It also implies a sense of variety and diversity in the types of scripts in this repo.

This is a monorepo that needs to grow from the many scripts that I have 'scattered' on my disk.
